# Frequent Check-ins

> "Hey, what have you been up to? Are you doing OK?"

In such a socially distant time, maintaining communication with work teams,
friends and other relationships is vital. As the world pivoted to working from
home, Marketing scholar Michelle is exceptionally grateful to be at a company
equipped with the necessary technology resources to make this transition quickly
and effectively. Some strategies she has personally undertaken to ensure open
and clear communication at work include "Making a conscious effort to discuss
work projects through video call instead of email, which makes a BIG difference
to work productivity and also provides social connection!"

Checking up on your team regularly by scheduling meetings on Google Chat,
Whatsapp or other online platforms "daily instead of weekly", as Data Science
and Decisions scholar Laurel suggests, reduces the distance we feel navigating
life at home. End of quarter trivia nights on Kahoot, virtual morning coffee
catch-ups or online cards for birthdays are another great way to strengthen a
sense of community.

# Staying Informed But Not Too Informed

It can be difficult to find the balance between keeping up to date with life,
and feeling overwhelmed by the barrage of information conveyed through various
media outlets. I'm one to immediately click on the most recent news stream, but
I've been trying to reduce my intake of all the bleakness, economic and
political upheaval happening globally as it can take a toll on my mental health.
Whilst it is important to maintain an awareness of the current global climate,
taking the time out of my day to "switch off" (badum tss) is much needed too.

# New Possibilities

Here at Co-op Soc, our team has risen to the challenge of being exceptionally
creative in hosting online events. As a student society, some activities we've
looked at are online podcasts, movie nights, Spotify music countdowns, game
streamings and challenge events, just to name a few.

The ways in which we traditionally delivered our society goals have been
completely upturned, but with our engagement levels as high as ever, we're
incredibly excited about the endless horizon of new possibilities that have
been able to be facilitated via Zoom and social media (TikTok in particular, of
which I have been unashamedly obsessed with lately).

# Contingency Planning

Being flexible to change is something the Executive team have been motivated to
do. We have continued working on the key messages, events and actions we want to
achieve when this period is over; although, we have been met with numerous
challenges, particularly regarding the supply and production of our new
merchandise. Thus in a time of such change, contingency plans have been helpful
in allowing us to adapt quickly when obstacles arise.
